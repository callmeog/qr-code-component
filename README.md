## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On finishing this project i got some useful feedback from fellow developers who helped me in making sure that the site accessibility is done right. I also made use of flexbox and reduced the media queries to one.

- Below are some of the code implemented

``
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}


:root{
  --background-light-blue: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}

main{
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
``

### Continued development

I think i'm happy with what I came up with but, I would like to make fit on mobile.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp) - This helped me for the media queries and gave me better understanding. Its one of my go to resources
- [Dev.to](https://devdocs.io/css/media_queries) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand better. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
