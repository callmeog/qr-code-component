## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Building this project gave me more insite of how media queries work and how to center anything on the page with a simple snippet of css and it depends how you want to center it by specifying the %.

```
.container {
    margin: 19% auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I think i'm happy with what I came up with but, I would like to make fit on mobile.
